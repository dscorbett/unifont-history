1 Introduction
**************

This document describes the process of using the GNU Unifont utilities
to create a font.  The steps described in the "Using Graphical Tools"
section in the "Tutorial" chapter are more or less the steps that I
(Paul Hardy) followed to add thousands of glyphs to GNU Unifont, except
that I didn't have the luxury of just typing `make' to make a new font
while adding those glyphs in the beginning.

I streamlined the font build process after I was done drawing the
Unicode 5.1 glyphs.

If you have questions, please email `unifoundry@unifoundry.com'.  You

DISCLAIMER: Donald Knuth warned in his Metafont book that if someone
started designing type, they would never again be able to look at a
page of text normally and just read its content.  There is a point of
no return beyond which a serious font designer begins looking at how
individual letters in a font on a page are drawn, and how they might be
improved.  Be warned!

2.1 Unicode
===========

Unicode is an international standard to encode all the world's scripts
with one universal scheme.  Unicode is the default encoding for web
pages and is gaining popularity in many other applications.  To learn
more about Unicode, look at code charts, and see the latest
developments, check out

     http://unicode.org

Unifont follows the Unicode encoding scheme.  Unicode defines the
numeric value of a character, but does not define one particular font.
There can be (and are) many fonts that support a subset of Unicode
characters.

In 1998, Roman Czyborra observed that there was still no font, free or
commercial, with complete Unicode coverage.  He envisioned a
low-quality bitmapped font as an easy way to produce a font that
covered much of the Unicode standard.


File: unifont.info,  Node: Unifont Structure,  Next: Hex File Format,  Prev: Unicode,  Up: Tutorial

2.2 Unifont Structure
=====================

GNU Unifont is a bitmapped pixel font, which is also converted to an
outline TrueType font.  Roman Czyborra began this font in 1998 with a
goal of having one glyph rendered for each visible character in the
Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (Plane 0, the first 65,536
characters).  His original writing on this is at
`http://czyborra.com/unifont/'.

(Note that the term "character" is used very loosely here for
simplicity; the Unicode Standard has a stricter definition of what
constitutes a character.)

The font is dual-width.  Each character is 16 pixels tall, and either 8
or 16 pixels wide.  The characters are stored in a unique .hex file
format invented by Roman Czyborra as a convenient way of giving each
character exactly a one line specification.  Conversion between this
.hex format and BDF font format is trivial.

Glyphs can actually be 8, 16, 24, or 32 pixels wide, but this extended
capability should be considered experimental.  Prior to the release of
Unicode 10.0.0, hooks were put in place in some of the Unifont
utilities to allow for the possibility of future fonts to represent
complex glyphs such as Cuneiform.  Unicode 10.0.0 created a need for
quadruple-width glyphs (31 pixels wide, encoded as 32 pixels wide) for
some historic Chinese ideographs assigned to the BMP; that currently is
the only place glyphs other than single- or double-width are used.  As
a result, those Unifont utilities that support quadruple-width glyphs
have updated descriptions in the reference section of this document.

2.3 Hex File Format
===================

By convention, files containing the Unifont native font format have the
extension ".hex".  Their format is extremely simple, consisting of two
fields separated with a colon (":") and ending with a newline.

The first field is the Unicode code point, in hexadecimal.  For all
Plane 0 code points, this is a four digit hexadecimal number.
Hexadecimal digits are (in order) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B,
C, D, E, and F.  The Unicode Standard uses a hexadecimal number to
assign each character a location.  These locations are called "code
points" and their range is 0 through 10FFFF, inclusive.

The range 0000 through FFFF, inclusive, is called the Basic Multilingual
Plane (BMP), or Plane 0.  This plane contains glyphs for most of the
world's modern writing scripts.

Unifont utilities support glyphs across the entire Unicode range.  The
current distribution includes glyphs for Unicode's Plane 0, Plane 1
(the Supplemental Multilingual Plane, or SMP), and others.  Coverage of
the SMP is only partial.

The first field in a `.hex' file should be either four digits long for
the Basic Multilingual Plane, or six digits long for higher Unicode
planes, following the convention of the Unicode Standard.

The second field is a string of hexadecimal digits.  There are 32
digits for a character that is 8 pixels wide, and 64 digits for a
character that is 16 pixels wide.

The good news is you don't have to worry about these long digit
strings.  Roman Czyborra wrote a utility, `hexdraw', to convert .hex
fonts to a form that can be edited with a plain text editor, then
converted back into .hex format.

Paul Hardy wrote two utilities to do the same thing except with
bitmapped graphics images for editing with a graphics editor:
`unihex2bmp' converts a block of 256 characters into a graphics file,
and `unibmp2hex' converts such a graphics file back into .hex format.
These bitmaps display the 256 characters in a block arranged in a 16 by
16 character grid.  The graphics editor must maintain the image as a
monochrome (black and white) file, with one bit per pixel.  After
conversion from a .bmp file back to a .hex file, the next step is
conversion to a BDF font file.  A BDF file can only encode a pixel
being on or off (i.e., black or white only with no intermediate shades
of gray).

Andrew Miller later converted `unihex2bmp' and `unibmp2hex' to Perl,
transforming them into `unihex2png' and `unipng2hex', respectively.
These programs convert Unifont .hex files to and from Portable Network
Graphics files.

The `unihex2png',`unipng2hex', and `hexdraw' programs handle the full
Unicode code point range of 0x000000 through 0x10FFFF.  The
`unihex2bmp' and `unibmp2hex' programs support the full 32-bit unsigned
integer range of 0x00000000 through 0xFFFFFFFF, but have not been
tested extensively beyond the Unicode upper limit of 0x10FFFF.  The
range of the C programs might be truncated in the future to only cover
to 0x10FFFF, the limit of the Unicode code point space.


File: unifont.info,  Node: Using Graphical Tools,  Next: Using Hexdraw,  Prev: Hex File Format,  Up: Tutorial

2.4 Using Graphical Tools
=========================

Let's look at an example.  Suppose you want to modify the Coptic letters
in the range U+2C80..U+2CFF ("U+" is Unicode shorthand).  These letters
are in the upper half of the block U+2C00..U+2CFF.  The Unicode
utilities in this package refer to this as "page" 2C.  ("Page" is not a
Unicode term -- it is just a term unique to this package to refer to a
block of 256 code points/characters).

The steps to follow will be:

  1. Convert .hex version of the page 2C range as a 16 by 16 bitmapped
     grid.

  2. Modify the bitmap in any graphics editor, being careful to re-save
     it as a Windows Bitmap (.bmp) or Wireless Bitmap file when
     finished.

  3. Convert the modified bitmap back into a .hex font file.

  4. Merge the results with the original `unifont.hex' file (or
     whatever its name might be).

  5. Run `unidup' on the resulting file to guard against duplicate
     character definitions.

  6. Create the new bitmapped version of the font.

  7. Check the compiled font for duplicates.

  8. If there are duplicates, remove them and go back to Step 5.

  9. Create the new TrueType version or other versions of the font.


If the script has combining characters (such as accent glyphs), also
add their code points to the proper `*combining.txt' file in the
directory for the corresponding Unicode plane.  That way, when the font
is converted to TrueType those glyphs will have zero space.  For a
script with combining characters, all glyphs that can appear with
combining characters must have the same width so that the combining
characters will be properly positioned.

*Step 1:* Convert the .hex range into a bitmap grid.  Assuming our font
file is named `unifont.hex', type

     unihex2bmp -p2C < unifont.hex > uni2C.bmp

*Step 2:* Modify `uni2C.bmp' with your favorite graphics editor.  Note
that whatever graphics editor you use must preserve the file as a black
and white bitmap (monochrome), with one bit per pixel.  During editing,
you can draw guidelines outside the actual 16x16 font pixel area; they
will be ignored when converting back into .hex format.  You can also
erase the grid borders between code points on purpose or by accident,
and it will have no effect on the generated .hex file.  Just don't
erase the code point numbers on the outer edges of the grid.  The
conversion from .bmp back to .hex only looks at the "U+0000" in the
upper left-hand corner of the bitmap graphic and other code point
numbers, and at each code point's 16x16 pixel area inside its 32x32
pixel grid area.  Every other artifact in the final graphics file
outside these areas is ignored.

If a new version of Unicode adds glyphs to a page that were previously
unassigned, be sure to remove the newly-assigned code points from the
`unassigned.hex' file because the code point is no longer unassigned.

*Step 3:* Convert the edited .bmp file back into .hex format:

     unibmp2hex < uni2C.bmp > uni2C.hex

Note that the conversion from a bitmap image to a .hex file can't
distinguish between a legitimate single- or double-width space
character and a code point that does not have an assigned value.
Therefore, space glyphs are separately contained in the `spaces.hex'
file.

*Step 4:* Merge the results with the original `unifont.hex' file.  This
requires several sub-steps:

   * Edit the original `unifont.hex' file and delete the lines that
     begin with "2C".

   * Insert the `uni2C.hex' file into `unifont.hex', either with a text
     editor such as `emacs' or `vi', or with a GNU/Linux command such
     as:

          sort uni2C.hex unifont.hex > new-unifont.hex

     This second option (using `sort') is preferred, because `unidup'
     (in Step 5) might miss duplicate code points if your final result
     isn't in proper order.


*Step 5:* Make sure there are no duplicates with `unidup':

     unidup < unifont.hex

or

     unidup < new-unifont.hex

depending on the name of your final font file.  If there is no output,
your modified font contains no duplicates.

This editing is best done on an input .hex file, such as
`unifont-base.hex'.

*Step 6:* Create the new bitmapped version of the font.  In the `font/'
directory, type

     make hex

*Step 7:* Check the compiled font for duplicates.  Change to the
`font/compiled/' directory and run

     unidup < mynewfontfile.hex

for whatever font file you created.

*Step 8:* If there are duplicates, remove them in the `font/' directory
and go back to Step 5.

*Step 9:* Create the new TrueType version of the font and all other
bitmapped versions.  From the `font/' directory, type

     make distclean && make

Then be prepared to wait a long time unless you are using a computer
with plenty of RAM and CPU horsepower.  Your computer should have at
least 256 Megabytes of virtual memory (RAM), and at least 250 Megabytes
of free disk space.

To only create a BDF font, in the `font/' directory just type

     make bdf

To only create a BDF and PCF font, in the `font/' directory type

     make pcf

Creating a BDF font is the first step in creating a PCF font (not
counting generating the compiled master ".hex" input file).  BDF fonts
can be created just with the tools in this package.  PCF fonts are
created by running `bdftopcf' on the BDF font.  TrueType fonts require
FontForge.

The Unifont package also includes two programs for working with
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files instead of BMP files.  These
utilities are `unihex2png' and `unipng2hex'.  They work in a similar
manner to the corresponding programs `unihex2bmp' and `unibmp2hex',
respectively.

To use `unihex2png' instead of `unihex2bmp', continuing the example of
the Coptic script in the U+2Cxx range, type:

     unihex2png -p 2C -i unifont.hex -o uni2C.png

Note that with `unihex2bmp' specifying input and output files is
optional, while with `unihex2png' at least the PNG filename must be
specified explicitly.  More specifically, `unihex2png' will read a .hex
file format input from STDIN if no "-i" argument is specified, but the
name of the binary PNG file must always be specified with the "-o"
option.

Then edit the resulting PNG file to your heart's content.  When done,
convert the file back into a `unifont.hex' format file.  In this
example, type:

     unipng2hex -i uni2C.png -o uni2C.hex

Similar to `unihex2png', the binary PNG file must be specified with
"-i" but the .hex format file will be written to STDOUT if the "-o"
option is omitted.

Finally, merge  your changes in with your main .hex font file as
described previously in this section.

2.5 Using Hexdraw
=================

Roman Czyborra's original utility to edit glyphs is the `hexdraw' Perl
script.  Using the same script as in the previous chapter, Coptic, here
are the steps for modifying `unifont.hex' using `hexdraw'.

First, realize that Unifont has tens of thousands of glyphs
(characters, using the term character loosely).  In this example, out
of the tens of thousands of glyphs, we want to modify the range
U+2C80..U+2CFF (only 128 glyphs).

The range U+2C80..U+2CFF could be extracted from `unifont.hex' by using
the `egrep' utility to look for lines beginning with "2C8" through
"2CF", or that range could be isolated by copying `unifont.hex' into
another file, and deleting all lines except the desired range.

The following steps will probably minimize typographical errors, but
they aren't the only way.

  1. "Grep" the desired block of 256 glyphs (using the `grep' utility)
     and convert this into a text representation for editing.

  2. Edit the block with a text editor, such as `emacs' or `vi'.

  3. Convert the edited text file back into .hex format.

  4. Delete the edited block range from the original font file.

  5. Merge the two .hex files into one file.

  6. Check for duplicates with `unidup'.

  7. Generate new fonts as described in the "Using Graphical Tools"
     section above.


*Step 1:* Extract the desired block with `grep':

     grep "^2C" unifont.hex | hexdraw > uni2C.txt

*Step 2:* Edit `uni2C.txt' with a text editor.

*Step 3:* Convert the text file back into .hex format:

     hexdraw < uni2C.txt > uni2C.hex

*Step 4:* Delete the lines in the original `unifont.hex' file that
begin with "2C".

*Step 5:* Merge the two files:

     sort unifont.hex uni2C.hex > new-unifont.hex

or use Roman's `hexmerge' utility:

     hexmerge unifont.hex uni2C.hex > new-unifont.hex

*Step 6:* Check for duplicates:

     unidup < new-unifont.hex

Of course, remove any reported duplicates.

*Step 7:* Build the font as in the "Using Graphical Tools" section
above.  This can be as simple as typing

     make

in the `font/' directory.

I (Paul Hardy) had only used `hexdraw' in the very beginning of my work
on Unifont.  Once I got my graphics programs working, I ignored it for
months.  Then I wanted to go through all of the Yi Syllables and Yi
Radicals -- over 1000 glyphs -- to fine-tune their horizontal alignment
after I drew them.  `hexdraw' turned out to be the perfect tool for
this.  By printing hyphens ("-") as place holders where a pixel is off,
it allowed me to verify space to the left and right of each character.
I later used `hexdraw' for similar fine-tuning of spacing on Hangul and
other glyphs.  It is ideal for the task.


File: unifont.info,  Node: Checking Coverage,  Next: Custom Builds,  Prev: Using Hexdraw,  Up: Tutorial

2.6 Checking Coverage
=====================

There should never be duplicates in a .hex file.  If there are, remove
them before the .hex font is turned into a BDF or other font file.  The
recommendations above include making liberal use of `unidup' to avoid
such a situation.

The `unipagecount' program will print a hexadecimal number of code
points that have coverage within each 256 code point block.  The
hexadecimal number will therefore range from 0 (no coverage) to 100 (=
256 decimal; full coverage).  If a number is ever more than 100
hexadecimal, there's an extra character (glyph) for that page.

To further look at the coverage within just one 256 code point page
(using page 2C, containing Coptic, as our example) use

     unipagecount -p2C < unifont.hex

Note that the "page number" can use upper- or lower-case letters:
`-p2C' or `-p2c' will both work.  That will print a 16 x 16 grid of
U+2C00..U+2CFF.  Of course, without placeholder glyphs for the
unassigned code points from `unassigned.hex' in the U+2C00..U+2CFF
range, unipagecount can give a lower number than the true coverage.

Using the `-l' flag with `unipagecount' will produce an HTML table with
links to corresponding graphics images.  You can get an idea of how
this works in the `font/compiled/' directory after running `make'; the
`index.html' file in that directory will have a table with links to the
256 glyph maps in the `font/compiled/bmp/' subdirectory.

With `unipagecount', the background color of the cells will range from
red (for 0% complete in that 256 code point block) to orange (a little
coverage) to yellow (more coverage) to green (complete coverage).  If a
cell looks light red or pink, the corresponding code page probably has
duplicate characters.  Verify that with

     sort unifont.hex | unidup

(substituting the name of your .hex file for `unifont.hex').

To see the coverage of each Unicode script, copy the file
`font/coverage.dat' into the same directory as the `unifont.hex' file
you're examining.  Then run

     unicoverage < unifont.hex > coverage.out

This will give you all the scripts within the Unicode Basic
Multilingual Plane, in order, with a percentage (0.0% through 100.0%)
of each script's coverage.  Note that to get the true coverage of
assigned code points, you'll have to merge `unassigned.hex' with the
rest of `unifont.hex' if not done by default in your setup.

Using the .hex files in `font/plane00/', you can create a font with all
available glyphs with

     sort font/plane00/*.hex >unifont-whole.hex

and run `unicoverage' using the resulting `unifont-whole.hex' file.


File: unifont.info,  Node: Custom Builds,  Next: One Glyph per File,  Prev: Checking Coverage,  Up: Tutorial

2.7 Custom Builds
=================

The font can be built from within the `font/' directory by simply typing

     make

From the top-level directory (one level above the `font/' directory),
typing

     make BUILDFONT=1

will also build the font.  The font is not built by default by typing
`make' from the top-level directory, because a pre-built version
already exists in the `font/precompiled/' directory.  Font files are
architecture-independent, so the only reason to build the font is if
you modify its composition.

By default, source glyphs are read from the `font/plane00/' directory.
Glyphs for unassigned code points are built into the font by default,
but glyphs for Private Use Area code points are not built into the font.

All of the .hex file names can be replaced selectively on the `make'
command line to override their default values.  Their locations are
relative to the `font/' directory.  The list of component hex file
variables is:

     `UNIFONTBASE'The bulk of Unifont scripts
     `CJK'       Most of the CJK Ideographs
     `CUSTOM00'  Hand-drawn quadruple-length Plane 0 glyphs
     `HANGUL'    Hangul Syllables block
     `SPACES'    Space glyphs, single- and double-width
     `UNASSIGNED'Glyphs for unassigned code points
     `PUA'       Glyphs for the Private Use Area

So, for example, to build a font that includes four-digit hexadecimal
code point glyphs (as white digits on a black background) for the
Private Use Area, type

     make PUA="plane00/pua.hex"

because those glyphs reside in the `font/plane00/pua.hex' file.

To build a font that includes your own special PUA glyphs, type

     make PUA="my-cool-PUA.hex"

or whatever the name of your PUA glyph .hex file is named.

To create a build that includes the supplied PUA glyphs but not the
unassigned code point glyphs, type

     make PUA="plane00/pua.hex" UNASSIGNED=""

If you create a custom font build of your own in one gigantic file, you
can build with just this file by declaring all the ordinary files to be
null:

     make UNIFONTBASE="mycustomfont.hex" \

     CJK="" HANGUL="" UNASSIGNED="" PUA=""

Note that this command did not include an override for the glyphs for
spaces contained in the `font/plane00/spaces.hex' file; that is, the
variable SPACES was not redefined on the command line.  You could also
pass the argument SPACES="", but just be aware that those spaces glyphs
are in a separate file for a reason.  When graphical (".bmp") glyph
files are converted back into hex string (".hex") format, the
`unibmp2hex' utility doesn't know if a blank glyph area is a space
glyph or not, so it doesn't encode anything.  The
`font/plane00/spaces.hex' file contains glyphs that are strings of 0s,
with length depending on whether the space is nominally a single- or
double-width space.  (Unifont does not distinguish between finer
spacing used in traditional typesetting, such as a thin space, en space,
em space, or quad space; all spaces are either 8 pixels wide or 16
pixels wide.)

2.8 One Glyph per File
======================

The `unifont1per' program will read a Unifont ".hex" file from standard
input and create bitmap output files, one file per Unicode code point
in the ".hex" file.  This can be useful if you want to include single
glyphs as graphic objects for illustration in a document or web page.
Output files have names of the form "U+<codepoint>.bmp", where
"<codepoint>" is the Unicode code point of the glyph.

Note that if you feed `unifont1per' a huge file of glyph hexadecimal
strings, you will get a directory loaded with individual ".bmp" files,
so use your judgment!


File: unifont.info,  Node: Viewing a Unifont File Interactively,  Next: Seeing the Big Picture (Literally!),  Prev: One Glyph per File,  Up: Tutorial

2.9 Viewing a Unifont File Interactively
========================================

The `unifont-viewer' Perl script uses the `wxWidgets' Perl library to
present a dynamic graphical representation of a Unifont hex file.  This
is a convenient way to scan quickly through a complete Unifont hex file.
It is ideal for scanning through a Unifont hex source file after you
have made changes.

Use `unifont-viewer' to open any Unifont hex file, whether in the Basic
Multilingual Plane up to the maximum Unicode code point of U+10FFFF.
The font is displayed graphically in sections of 16-by-16 glyph grids
(256 glyphs--a "page" in Unifont lingo).  The page numbers (the upper
portion of the hexadecimal code point range) appear in a list along the
left-hand side.  Only page ranges that are present in the Unifont hex
file are listed.

When `unifont-viewer' loads a hex file, it begins by displaying the
first "page" range in that file.

2.10 Seeing the Big Picture (Literally!)
========================================

The GNU Unifont 6.3 release introduced a new program, `unifontpic'.
This produces a chart of all the Basic Multilingual Plane glyphs in
Unifont.  By default the chart is arranged as a 256-by-256 glyph table.
Specifying the `-l' option produces a chart that is 16 glyphs wide by
4,096 glyphs long.  See unifontpic(1) for more information.

The "long" version, created with `unifontpic -l', only produces 16
glyphs per row.  This is more useful for scrolling through on a
computer screen.

GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, will properly display the
resulting long .bmp file (at least under GNOME), but not all graphics
utilities can.  The output file is over 65,536 pixel rows tall, which
causes problems with some graphics programs.

To generate a chart with all your glyphs in one giant `unifont.hex'
file, type the command

     unifontpic < unifont.hex > unifont.bmp

The output is a monochrome Bitmap Graphics Format (.bmp) file.  If you
prefer PNG files, use your favorite graphics program or conversion
program to convert the BMP file to a PNG file.

This utility is especially useful if you're customizing the font, for
example if adding your own Private Use Area glyphs.

Single-width and double-width glyphs are reproduced in this bitmap file
at the correct aspect ratio.  Triple-width and quadruple-width glyphs
will be compressed 50% in the horizontal dimension to fit within a
16-by-16 pixel glyph cell.

The default 256-by-256 code point chart will render satisfactorily on a
sheet of paper approximately 3 feet by 3 feet (1 meter by 1 meter) at
120 dots per inch.  Thus the square format is suitable for printing.

2.11 Combining Circles
======================

The earliest versions of Unifont (before the 5.1 release) used glyphs
that showed dashed circles for combining characters.  This is how the
glyphs appear in The Unicode Standard code charts.  In version 5.1,
Paul Hardy was able to get combining characters to appear superimposed
correctly in the TrueType version of the font.  (There are no plans to
try to get combining characters to work in a BDF or PCF version owing
to the limitations of those bitmapped font formats.)

With combining characters working in the TrueType font, Paul Hardy
created variations of Unifont with and without combining circles, the
idea being that the version without combining circles would be used to
create the TrueType font.  The variation with combining circles was
kept for reference.

Unifont Version 6.2 simplified the build to produce only one font
variation, without combining circles.

Unifont Version 6.3 introduced a new utility, `unigencircles', to
superimpose combining circles over glyphs with code points in a
`combining.txt' file.

The latest Unifont release contains a parallel set of font files named
`unifont_sample.*'.  These "Unifont Sample" font files contain glyphs
with combining circles where appropriate.  The "Unifont Sample" font is
therefore not intended for general-purpose writing, but only for
illustrating each individual glyph as represented in The Unicode
Standard.

To run `unigencircles', start with the file `font/ttfsrc/combining.txt'
and type a command of this form:

     unigencircles combining.txt < unifont.hex > unifont-circles.hex

where `unifont.hex' is a single file containing all the glyphs you wish
to render.  You could create such a file from the `font/' directory
with the command

     sort plane00/*.hex >unifont.hex

Because the output is another .hex file, you can use all Unifont
utilities with this resulting file just as you would with the .hex files
in `font/plane00/'.

If you want to build a font from this generated `unifont.hex' file, you
could type

     make UNIFONTBASE="unifont-circles.hex" CJK="" HANGUL="" \

     UNASSIGNED="" PUA=""

as discussed above.  In this case, if you included
`font/plane00/spaces.hex' in the `unifont.hex' input file, you should
also set SPACES="" on the command line so that you only read in your
final custom `unifont-circles.hex' file.

2.12 Installing Fonts on GNU/Linux
==================================

The original standard font format of Unifont was a BDF font.  The newer
PCF font format loads much faster when a program begins, and so is
preferable for installations using the X Window System and similar
environments.

Compress PCF fonts using

     gzip -9 fontname.pcf

Copy the resulting `fontname.pcf.gz' file to
`/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/' or place in a local font directory if your
windowing software supports that (for example, `~/.fonts/').

Copy TrueType fonts to `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/' uncompressed or
place in your local font directory.  Note: on some versions of Unix,
such as Solaris, the name of the TrueType directory might be TrueType
and might be under `/usr/share/fonts/X11/' -- examine the system fonts
directories, then modify the font `make install' rule accordingly.

On most flavors of GNU/Linux with the latest `xset' utility (including
the latest Debian and Red Hat releases), the following command should
allow you to start using the font immediately:

     xset fp rehash

The safest way to make sure the system knows about the new fonts will
be to restart the X Window System or even reboot.

2.13 Creating a Brand New Font
==============================

The original tools will only produce glyphs that are 16 pixels tall, and
either 8 or 16 pixels wide.  The utilities `unihex2png', `unipng2hex',
`hexdraw', and `hex2bdf' now also support glyph heights of 24 and 32
pixels, and glyph widths of 8, 16, 24, and 32 pixels, but this is not
fully tested.  PNG glyphs that are 32 pixels wide are only supported if
the glyphs are also 32 pixels tall.  These dimensions are available for
experimental use.  See the respective sections for each of these
programs in the Reference chapter of this document, or their respective
man pages.

To create a brand new font (or even to add a new script to Unifont in
the future), plan out the basic dimensions of the characters:

   * How far above the lowest pixel will the baseline appear (in other
     words, how many rows are necessary for descenders such as in the
     glyphs for `g', `q', and `y')?

   * How many pixels must be empty on top and bottom for accents (in
     other words, what will the height of capital letters be)?

   * Must glyphs be centered, left-aligned, or right-aligned?

   * For a Latin font, what will the "x-height" be (the height of a
     lower-case "x" and related letters, such as "n" and "r")?


Consistent capital heights, x-heights, descender depths, and centering
will produce a better looking font.  Look over the entire script and
plan out a template grid that is consistent for the entire script.
Then use that template for each glyph you draw for the script.

Unifont characters for the most part leave the left-most or right-most
column of pixels blank if possible (consistent within each script) for
left-to-right scripts.  Centering is done around the fourth pixel (if a
glyph is eight pixels wide) or around the eighth pixel (if a glyph is
16 pixels wide).

Experimenting and (above all) having fun with these utilities is the
best way to learn.


File: unifont.info,  Node: Updates to Unicode,  Prev: Creating a Brand New Font,  Up: Tutorial

2.14 Updates to Unicode
=======================

If a currently unassigned code point is assigned to a character in the
future, the font can be updated as follows:

  1. Delete the code point's entry from `font/plane00/unassigned.hex',
     as that code point will no longer be unassigned.

  2. Determine which existing .hex file should contain the newly
     defined character (examine the files to see which one contains
     other glyphs in the script.

        * `unifont-base.hex' contains most scripts

        * `wqy.hex' contains most CJK ideographs; its name pays homage
          to the Wen Quan Yi font, the source of almost all of its
          glyphs

        * `hangul-syllables.hex' contains the Hangul Syllables block
          (U+AC00..U+D7A3); this should never have new code points
          added as it covers the fixed range of the Unicode Hangul
          Syllables block

        * `spaces.hex' contains the list of single- and double-width
          spaces


     If in doubt (for example, if a new script is added to Unicode and
     you're not sure which .hex file to augment), add the new glyphs to
     `unifont-base.hex'.

  3. Update the appropriate .hex file.

  4. Consider if `font/coverage.dat' has to be updated.  Follow its
     existing format to insert a new script, being sure to change any
     previously unassigned ranges before or after the newly added
     script.

  5. Make a new .hex version of the font, and verify that you didn't
     introduce any duplicates.

  6. Run `unipagecount' and/or `unicoverage' as described previously to
     verify that you have not mistakenly deleted any existing
     characters.


Enjoy!

to extract CJK ideographs from the 16x16 version of Wen Quan Yi's BDF
font.  Currently the program is hard-coded to only extract those code
points that comprise the "wqy.hex" source font file used to build
"unifont.hex" but this source code could easily be modified.

-----------------------------

unibmp2hex reads a bitmap produced by unihex2bmp before or after
editing, and converts it back into a Unifont .hex format file.  The
graphics file contains a block of 256 Unicode code points arranged in a
16 by 16 grid.  Each code point appears in a 32 by 32 pixel grid.
Characters are 16 rows high, and 8, 16, or 31 (treated as 32) columns
wide.

3.10.4 unibmp2hex OPTIONS
-------------------------

`-p'
     Specify that the code points will be assigned to the 256 block
     space pagenum in the .hex file.  If not specified, unibmp2hex will
     determine the appropriate block by reading the row and column
     headers.  Note that "page" is not a standard Unicode term.  It
     refers to an output bitmap graphics page of 16 by 16 code points.
     If pagenum is greater than FF, the block resides above the Unicode
     Basic Multilingual Plane. In that event, the .hex file will contain
     eight digit hexadecimal code points rather than the Unifont
     standard of four hexadecimal code points.

`-i'
     Specify the input file. The default is STDIN.

`-o'
     Specify the output file. The default is STDOUT.

`-w'
     Force all output .hex glyphs to be 16 pixels wide rather than dual
     width (8 or 16 pixels).

No known real bugs exist, except that this software does not perform
extensive error checking on its input files.  If they're not in the
format of the original bitmapped output from unihex2bmp, all bets are
off.

If the output file is for a "page" containing space code points and the
bitmap file squares for those code points are not empty, unibmp2hex
preserves the graphics as they are drawn.

3.11.3 unibmpbump DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------

unibmpbump reads a Microsoft Bitmap Graphics (".bmp") graphics image
file and, if it appears to be in a known format, converts it for
processing by unibmp2hex(1).

unibmpbump supports the following Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) header
byte lengths for input image files:

    `12'
          The BITMAPCOREHEADER format.  This was the original Microsoft
          Windows header format.  It has not been encoutered, and was
          added only as a subset of the formats that appear below.

    `40'
          The BITMAPINFOHEADER format.  This is the format that most
          graphics creation programs support, and is the header format
          that unibmp2hex expects.

    `108'
          The BITMAPV4HEADER format.  This is the format that the Image
          Magick convert program creates when converting a PNG image to
          a BMP image using the "-monochrome" option.

    `124'
          The BITMAPV5HEADER format.  This is the format that the Image
          Magick convert program creates when converting a PNG image to
          a BMP image without the "-monochrome" option; convert will
          encode the image as a "grayscale" image, but with only two
          colors: black and white.



unibmpbump is able to read files created by unihex2png that were
subsequently saved as BMP files, for example by the convert(1) program,
which is part of the Image Magick package.  Images created by
unihex2png(1) are 544 rows high by 560 columns wide.  Images created by
unihex2bmp(1) are 544 rows high by 576 columns wide.  Thus, if the
input Bitmap Graphics file is 544 by 560 pixels, unibmpbump assumes
that the file was originally a Portable Network Graphics (".png") file
created by unihex2png and realigns the glyphs so they are positioned as
unibmp2hex expects.


File: unifont.info,  Node: unibmpbump OPTIONS,  Next: unibmpbump FILES,  Prev: unibmpbump DESCRIPTION,  Up: unibmpbump

3.11.4 unibmpbump OPTIONS
-------------------------

`-i'
     Specify an input Bitmaps Graphics (".bmp") file.  If no input file
     is specified, input is taken from stdin.  The input file must be
     either 544 rows by 560 columns (for a file created by unihex2png
     originally) or 544 rows by 576 columns (for a file created by
     unihex2bmp originally).

`-o'
     Specify an output Bitmaps Graphics (".bmp") file.  If no output
     file is specified, output is sent to stdout.  The output file will
     be 544 rows high by 576 columns wide with a 40 byte Device
     Independent Bitmap (DIB) header, which is the format that
     unibmp2hex expects.

`-v, --verbose'
     Verbose output.  Print information about the input file on stderr.

`-V, --version'
     Print the version of unibmpbump and exit.

---------------------------------

unifont-viewer reads a GNU Unifont .hex file and displays glyphs in
blocks of 16 by 16, 256 glyphs per screen with a graphical user
interface.  The .hex file is selected by opening it with the File > Open
menu item or by typing Control-O.  After loading a file, a list of
"pages" of 256 glyphs will appear in the left-hand column of the
window.  The first such page of glyphs in the file will appear in the
main window.

unifont-viewer supports glyph heights of 16, 24, and 32 pixels.  The
height of a .hex font file is selected under the File menu.  The
default selection is Glyph Height 16.

Exit unifont-viewer by selecting File > Exit or by typing Control-X.

3.15.3 unifont1per DESCRIPTION
------------------------------

unifont1per reads a GNU Unifont .hex file and for each code point in
the file, creates an output Bitmapped Graphics (".bmp") file in the
current directory.  The filename for each output file is
"U+codepoint.bmp", where codepoint is the Unicode codepoint for the
glyph.

Each glyph entry in a Unifont .hex file is expected to be 16 rows tall,
and can be 8, 16, 24, or 32 pixels wide.  The glyph sizes in output
files are determined on a glyph-by-glyph basis.

This program can be of use in extracting individual glyphs to display
in a document or on a web page.

WARNING!  This program generates one output file per code point that
appears in the input stream.  If you feed this program a file with 1000
code points, it will generate 1000 files in your current directory.

File: unifont.info,  Node: unifontpic DESCRIPTION,  Next: unifontpic OPTIONS,  Prev: unifontpic SYNOPSIS,  Up: unifontpic

3.18.3 unifontpic DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------

unifontpic reads a GNU Unifont .hex file from STDIN and writes a two
dimensional rendering for each glyph to STDOUT.  The output displays an
entire Unicode plane of 65,536 glyphs as one large graphic image,
showing a grid of 256 glyphs by 256 glyphs as the default, or (at your
option) a long version of 16 glyphs across by 4,096 glyphs down.

Input can be one or more files in Unifont .hex format.  They don't have
to be sorted, as unifontpic will populate the entire glyph array of
65,536 code points before writing its output.  The input glyph code
points should all be unique, as feeding in duplicate code points will
produce unpredictable results.  Use unidup (1) on a sorted input of
.hex files to guarantee no code point duplication.


File: unifont.info,  Node: unifontpic OPTIONS,  Next: unifontpic EXAMPLES,  Prev: unifontpic DESCRIPTION,  Up: unifontpic

3.18.4 unifontpic OPTIONS
-------------------------

`-d'
     Specify a Dots per Inch (DPI) resolution of nnn.  For example,
     specifying -d120 will encode the bitmap graphics file output as
     having a resolution of 120 DPI.

`-l'
     Produce a long chart, 16 glyphs wide by 4,096 glyphs tall.  The
     default is a wide chart, 256 glyphs wide by 256 glyphs tall.

`-t'
     Use tiny numbers for the row and column code point labels.  Tiny
     numbers are on a 4 by 5 pixel grid.  Only tiny code point labels
     appear on the long chart variant; this option only has effect for
     wide charts (the default, of 256 by 256 glyphs).  If this option
     is not specified for the default 256-by-256 grid, row and column
     code point labels are taken from Unifont's glyphs for `0' to `9'
     and `A' to `F'.

`-P'
     Print a chart for Unicode plane number plane.  The default is
     Plane 0, the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).  The range of
     Unicode plane range is 0 through 17, inclusive.  The plane number
     is printed on the chart title line.

File: unifont.info,  Node: unigencircles DESCRIPTION,  Next: unigencircles EXAMPLE,  Prev: unigencircles SYNOPSIS,  Up: unigencircles

3.19.3 unigencircles DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------

unigencircles reads a unifont.hex file from STDIN, adds dashed combining
circles to the hex strings for code points listed in "combining.txt"
but not listed in "nonprinting.hex", and writes the revised set of
glyphs in unifont.hex format to STDOUT.  The resulting combining
character glyphs show the dashed combining circles that appear in The
Unicode Standard code charts.

For each code point listed in the "combining.txt" file but not listed
in the "nonprinting.hex" file, unigencircles will superimpose a
single-width dashed circle in glyphs that are single-width (i.e., their
hex glyph strings are 32 characters long) and will superimpose a
double-width dashed circle in glyphs that are double-width (i.e., their
hex glyph strings are 64 characters long).

3.21.3 unihex2bmp DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------

unihex2bmp reads a GNU Unifont .hex file Unicode page of 256 code points
and converts the page into a Microsoft Windows Bitmap (.bmp) or
Wireless Bitmap (.wbmp) file.  The bitmap file displays the glyphs of a
Unicode block of 256 code points in a 32 by 32 pixel grid.  The glyphs
themselves must be 16 rows high, and 8, 16, 24, or 31 (encoded as 32)
columns wide. The default page is 0; that is, the range U+0000 through
U+00FF.

The bitmap can be printed.  It can also be edited with a bitmap editor.
An edited bitmap can then be re-converted into a GNU Unifont .hex file
with the unibmp2hex command.

3.22.3 unihex2png DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------

unihex2png reads a page of 256 Unicode code points from a GNU Unifont
.hex file and converts the page into a Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
file.  The graphics file displays the glyphs of a Unicode block of 256
code points in a 32 by 32 pixel grid, or in a 40 by 40 pixel grid if
"-r 32" is specified.  The glyphs themselves can be either 16, 24, or
32 pixels tall depending on the "-r" parameter.  They can be 8, 16, 24,
or 32 pixels wide (widths of 32 are only supported if "-r 32" is
specified).  The default page is 0; that is, the range U+0000 through
U+00FF, inclusive.

The PNG file can be printed.  It can also be edited with a graphics
editor.  An edited PNG file can then be re-converted into a GNU Unifont
.hex file with the unipng2hex command.

-----------------------

No known real bugs exist, but the optional pixel rows parameter is not
yet supported by all other Unifont utilities.  Use of glyphs taller than
the default of 16 pixels is considered experimental.  Currently
unihex2png, unipng2hex, hexdraw, and hex2bdf tentatively support glyphs
that are 16, 24, and 32 pixels tall.

Also, there is no extensive error checking on input files.  If they're
not in the format of the original GNU Unifont .hex file, all bets are
off.  Lines can be terminated either with line feed, or carriage return

3.23.3 unihexfill DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------

unihexfill is a shell script that reads a list of code point ranges
from STDIN and produces filler glyphs of 4- or 6-digit code points on
STDOUT.  The format of the input file is a combination of comment lines,
single code points on a line, and start/stop pairs of code points on a
line separated by a space.  Comment lines start with a semicolon (';')
by convention.  Start and stop code points are strings of hexadecimal
digits, by convention either four or six digits.  unihexfill invokes
unihexgen for each non-comment line in its input file.  If a codepoint
is less than or equal to "FFFF" (i.e., 0xFFFF), a four-digit
hexadecimal number is encoded within the corresponding Unifont glyph as
two digits on each of two rows.  Otherwise, a six-digit hexadecimal
number is encoded as three digits on each of two rows.

unihexrotate - rotate Unifont hex glyphs in quarter turn increments


File: unifont.info,  Node: unihexrotate SYNOPSIS,  Next: unihexrotate DESCRIPTION,  Prev: unihexrotate NAME,  Up: unihexrotate

3.25.2 unihexrotate SYNOPSIS
----------------------------

unihexrotate [-n quarter-turns] [input-font.hex] > output-font.hex


File: unifont.info,  Node: unihexrotate DESCRIPTION,  Next: unihexrotate OPTIONS,  Prev: unihexrotate SYNOPSIS,  Up: unihexrotate

3.25.3 unihexrotate DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------

unihexrotate reads a GNU Unifont .hex format file named on the command
line, or from stdin if no filename is given.  If a number of quarter
turns is specified, it rotates each glyph clockwise by that number of
quarter turns, or counterclockwise if the number is negative.  The
resulting modified .hex file is written to stdout.  The format of a
.hex file is described in the unifont(5) man page.

If the number of quarter turns is not specified, unihexrotate will
rotate each glyph by a default value of one quarter turn (i.e., 90
degrees) clockwise.

unihexrotate only supports Unifont .hex files with glyphs that are 8
columns and 16 columns wide.  If an 8-column glyph is rotated, it is
first centered within a 16-column glyph so the rotation will be
performed on a 16-by-16 pixel glyph.  One additional use of this
program is that a glyph can be converted from 8\~columns wide to
16\~columns wide by specifying a rotation of 0\~quarter turns.

3.25.4 unihexrotate OPTIONS
---------------------------

`-n'
     Specify an integer number of quarter turn clockwise rotations to
     perform, typically as "-n\~0" through "-n\~3" (alternatively as
     "-n=0" through "-n=3") for rotations of 0, 90, 180, or 270
     degrees, respectively.  Negative values will perform
     counterclockwise rotations by the specified number of quarter
     turns.

3.25.5 unihexrotate EXAMPLES
----------------------------

This example extracts the Mongolian glyphs in the "unifont-base.hex"
file (located in the "font/plane00" directory) and pipes them to
unihexrotate to rotate by the default amount of one quarter turn
clockwise (i.e., by 90 degrees).  The basic Mongolian glyphs are in the
Unicode range U+1800 through U+18AF.  The original glyphs in
"unifont-base.hex" are drawn for horizontal rendering (as per the
Unicode Standard).  The output rotated glyphs are suitable for
rendering Mongolian in its traditional vertical form.  Because no
filename is specified to unihexrotate in this example, its input is
taken from stdin.

     grep "^18[0-A]" unifont-base.hex | unihexrotate > vertical.hex


The next example reverses the rotation performed above, by one quarter
turn counterclockwise.  In this example, the input filename
"vertical.hex" is specified.

     unihexrotate -n -1 vertical.hex > horizontal.hex

3.26.3 unipagecount DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------

unipagecount reads a GNU Unifont .hex file from STDIN and prints a 16
by 16 grid of the number of defined code points in each 256 character
block within a Unicode plane to STDOUT.  Code points proceed from left
to right, then top to bottom.  In all planes, code points U+*FFFE and
U+*FFFF are not expected in the input hex file; they are reserved and
always counted as being present in a plane.

3.26.4 unipagecount OPTIONS
---------------------------

`-P'
     Select a Unicode plane, from 0 through 16, inclusive.  If not
     specified, unipagecount defaults to Plane 0 (the Basic
     Multilingual Plane).

`-p'
     Just print information on one 256 code point "page" rather than
     the entire Basic Multilingual Plane.  This prints a 16 by 16 table
     with an asterisk in every code point that has an assigned glyph.

`-h'
     Print an HTML table with color-coded cell background colors
     instead of a plain text table.

`-l'
     [The letter "l"]: Print hyperlinks to font bitmaps in the HTML
     table.  To create the bitmaps themselves, use the unihex2bmp
     program.  The bitmaps are assumed to be in the directory "bmp/".

-----------------------------

unipng2hex reads a PNG file produced by unihex2png before or after
editing, and converts it back into a Unifont .hex format file.  The PNG
file contains a block of 256 Unicode code points arranged in a 16 by 16
grid.  Each code point appears in a 32 by 32 or a 40 by 40 pixel grid.
Characters are either 16, 24 or 32 pixel rows high, depending on the
"-r" parameter specified by unihex2png.  They can be 8, 16, 24, or 32
pixel columns wide (widths of 32 are only supported for 32 pixel row
tall characters).

3.27.10 unipng2hex BUGS
-----------------------

No known real bugs exist, but the optional pixel rows parameter is not
yet supported by all other Unifont utilities.  Use of glyphs taller than
the default of 16 pixels is considered experimental.  Currently
unihex2png, unipng2hex, hexdraw, and hex2bdf tentatively support glyphs
that are 16, 24, and 32 pixels tall.

Also, this software does not perform extensive error checking on its
input files.  If they're not in the format of the original PNG output
from unihex2png, all bets are off.

If the output file is for a "page" containing space code points and the
PNG file squares for those code points are not empty, unipng2hex
preserves the graphics as they are drawn.

unipng2hex is designed to work with black and white pixels; do not use
other colors.
